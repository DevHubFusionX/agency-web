1. Core Brand Foundation (Non-negotiable)

These define what Nemvol is before visuals even matter.

Brand Positioning

Clear one-line value proposition (above the fold)

Example: “We build scalable web platforms for startups and businesses.”

Who you serve (startups, SMEs, SaaS founders, enterprises)

What problem you solve (speed, scale, reliability, execution)

Brand Voice & Tone

Confident, technical, calm

Not hype, not playful

Short, clear sentences

Consistent language across:

Website

CTAs

Case studies

Emails

2. Visual Identity System (White × Blue)

This ensures consistency everywhere.

Color System

Primary: White (background dominance)

Primary Accent: Blue (trust, stability)

Secondary Blue shades:

Dark blue (headers, nav)

Soft blue (background sections)

Neutral grays (text, borders)

Define:

Primary color

Accent color

Background color

Text color

Border/divider color

CTA color

Typography

Primary font (headings)

Secondary font (body text)

Font weights usage:

H1, H2, H3

Body

Caption

Line height and spacing rules

Avoid more than 2 font families.

3. Logo & Brand Marks

Even if minimal, this matters.

Primary logo (full)

Icon-only logo (favicon / app icon)

Light & dark versions

Clear space rules

Usage examples (header, footer, mobile)

If the logo is abstract, it must:

Work at small sizes

Be recognizable without text

4. Website Structure (Trust + Conversion)
Must-Have Pages

Home

Services

Case Studies / Work

About

Contact

Privacy Policy / Terms (huge trust booster)

Optional but powerful:

Blog / Insights

Pricing or “How we work”

Careers (even if empty)

5. Homepage Sections (Critical)

Your homepage should answer questions in this order:

Hero Section

Clear headline

One sentence explanation

Primary CTA

Secondary CTA

What You Do

3–6 clear service blocks

No fluff words

How You Work

Process steps (Discover → Build → Launch → Scale)

Proof

Case studies

Metrics

Client logos or testimonials

Why Nemvol

Differentiators

Technical credibility

Reliability signals

CTA Section

Strong, simple call to action

Booking or contact

6. Services Branding

Each service should feel like a product.

For each service:

Clear name

Problem it solves

What’s included

Tools/stack used

Outcome for the client

Avoid generic lists like:

“We offer high-quality solutions”

Be specific.

7. Case Studies (Very Important)

Even 1–2 strong ones matter.

Each case study should include:

Client background

Problem

Solution

Tech stack

Result (numbers if possible)

Screenshots or visuals

This is what sells Nemvol more than design.

8. UI & Design System

To look “proper” and professional:

Button styles (primary, secondary, disabled)

Card styles

Shadows & radius rules

Spacing system (8px / 16px / 24px)

Icon style (outline or solid—pick one)

Section background patterns

Consistency > creativity.

9. Trust & Credibility Signals

Most people forget this.

Real contact information

Professional email (no Gmail)

Social proof

Clear ownership (About page)

Security & privacy clarity

Fast load speed

Your site should feel safe to do business with.
